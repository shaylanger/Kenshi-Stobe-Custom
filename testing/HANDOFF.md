# Current checkpoint: m49 (2026-10-06)
Coordinator handoff: newest `coordinator-handoff-m<N>.md` in the temp folder (copy in `handoff/`). Run logs:
`archive/test-run-2026-10-05-m41.md` (m41-m48), `archive/test-run-2026-10-06-m49.md` (m49). Open rows: `MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md`.
- **Builds:** 5090 Stobe 7A8997FD (KenshiFP decoupling + 16-fb Hinge fix), PG BAFB8C31 (Normal), KenshiFP FE26573F (decoupled +
  eye-drift fix), harness 2995EE5E; 4080 PG BAFB8C31, KenshiFP FE26573F, harness 2995EE5E.
- **KenshiFP decoupling (m49, done):** goal/action logic now lives in Stobe (stobe_goals.log); DC1-DC7 PASS (DC1-DC5 with
  the KenshiFP DLL absent), 89, 14-A3, generic-fb, 16-fb 55/55, A8 PASS.
- **FP combat (m49):** R07, R08 (8/9, arm-occlusion + pose check), R09, R13, R11, FP-EYE PASS both rigs; M00-M07 PASS (4080);
  S04 PASS. Open: R10, R12 remainder (UI focus, KO, save/load, weapon swap, speed/FPS), M08/M09, Gate 3, S01/S03/S05;
  manual combat still OFF by default.
- **PG:** all automated rows PASS; D1-D3, D5-D8 done; open D4 athletics feel + tooltip/feel rows (Shay).
- **Waiting on Shay:** delete the 4080 save copies `kah-fp-*` (permission checker) (Avarek/Beaks DB rows deleted 2026-10-06)
  (approved, permission checker blocked) so the Full-Base hand-over/fetch regression row can run.
- **Fixture added:** `C:\KenshiTestFixtures\FP-crossbow` (from kah-fpxbow).
- **Graphics mods may still be OFF:** `bash C:/KenshiModding/tools/automation/gfx-mods.sh on` before playing.

Goal, batching, token-light test rules: CLAUDE.md "Start here" (Shay's standing orders, 2026-10-03/04). The m18-m40
checkpoints, to-do list and session notes were removed 2026-10-06 (all items done or tracked in the plans; history in
the run logs and `git log -p testing/HANDOFF.md`).

## Test efficiency rules (Shay, 2026-10-04; full text in CLAUDE.md "Test efficiency")
- Mechanical rows = deterministic: inject the model reply (NEG_TEST_INJECT ...) before the logic under test; prove the injection fired + real game/server change; switches restored on exit. Live-model rows = a small separate batch (prompt -> intended reply).
- Setup checks before long tests (shared helpers): out dir, fixture, selected chars, live NPC names/handles, inventory, worker/bench/materials/research/power/job, game time advancing, raid protection. Bounded polls, specific SETUP FAIL reason, repair then rerun.
- PG: per-point provenance (build/config/fixture/skill/gear/setup/evidence); no stale captures; reuse only compatible points; block reruns when points aren't independently resettable; investigate flat data even with 0 script failures.
- After each batch: reconcile (passes out of the plans, evidence in run log), classify every non-pass, map bugs to confirmations, rerun only invalidated passes; report requirement IDs and scenarios separately.

## New standing rules (Shay, 2026-10-04; full text in CLAUDE.md "PG validation gate" and "RAM budget")
- PG: 3-point validation gate (low skill/no gear, high skill/no gear, low skill/gear) before any full matrix; mechanical pass and balance acceptance tracked separately; one gate line per profession; one runner per machine, recorded here.
- RAM: parakeet STT off unless a test needs voice; PocketTTS off unless a batch tests audio (after checking replies still work without it); WSL cap 8 GB; graphics-only mods (Dust, ReShade, HD textures if worth it) off for automated runs, with a restore command for Shay.
- Both rules applied (m29, commits 2574235, cbc7148, 558154d). Per-profession gate results go below this line when the operator reports.
- **PG gate lines (m35, 4080 matrix m35 + 5090 batch T; throughput per profession, gear = s50 +50% unless noted; mechanical = gear moves the stat; balance = Shay/balance pass):**
  - armour smithing: s10 0.024 / s90 0.054 / +50% gain +27.7% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - weapon smithing: s10 0.034 / s90 0.077 / +25.6% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - crossbow smithing: s10 0.0064 / s90 0.0147 / +99.6% -> rerun m41: +7.1% / +14.1% at +25/+50%, lab50 ctl 1.000 (D5) -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - cooking: s10 0.127 / s90 0.287 / +23.6% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - farming: lowered to ~0.5/pt (D1): +25% gear +16.5%, +50% +29.7% -> row 206 PASS (4080 m41), balance accepted
  - robotics: s10 0.021 / s90 0.048 / +22.0% (lab50 ctl 0.84) -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - science: s10 21.5 / s90 47.7 / +23.1% (lab50 ctl 0.75) -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - engineering: s10 2.90 / s90 8.39 / +25.3% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - medic: gear raises kit quality (D2): +22.1% / +41.5% heal rate at +25 / +50% gear -> row 191 PASS (4080 m43)
  - assassination: s10 43.8 / s90 180 / s25+50% 92.7 / +36.7% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - lockpicking: s10 0.117 / s90 0.90 / s25+50% 0.483 / +70.0% -> mechanical PASS, balance open (lock level <= skill reads flat 0.9)
  - thievery: s10 0.11 / s90 0.99 / s25+50% 0.41 / +50.0% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - stealth: s10 0.70 / s90 1.30 / +16.7% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - swimming: s10 2.38 / s90 30.9 / +24.8% -> mechanical PASS, balance open
  - athletics (5090 batch T pg-85, swim 300 m s, lower = faster): s10 4.3 / s90 3.0 / own50 ~2.8 / lab50 ctl 3.5 -> mechanical PASS; acceleration hook (PG f212cbc) -> D4 feel row for Shay
  - turrets (pg-55, batch W, needs harness `turret ... aim`: the turret never targets a dummy by itself): skill01 0.10 / 0.90 / 0.15, dummy worst 5% / -27% KO / -58% KO -> mechanical PASS, balance accepted (D6)
  - perception: back on gear (m46 Shay); ranged gate PASS m47 (4080, PG 199a/b/c)

## Gotchas
- Full-Base world raids: `fullbase-guard.sh` after each Full-Base load; it protects both squad members, so wrappers that
  KO the mate must turn protect off first (park_malzin does since m18).
- `stobe-fight-lib.sh` is sourced by every wrapper: `bash -n` it after any edit (run via WSL with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`).
- Long WSL batches: start detached (`setsid nohup bash … &` inside WSL); Bash `run_in_background` dies at 10 min.
- Don't run Windows `python3` in Git Bash for repo scripts that need WSL paths; use WSL python3.
