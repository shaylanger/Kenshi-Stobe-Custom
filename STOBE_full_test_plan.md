# STOBE: open issues and tests left

Last updated 2026-10-06 (doc cleanup: 96/97 and the built + confirmed B 55 spec removed, trace in `archive/test-run-2026-10-05-m41.md`; older run logs are in git history). Installed builds and run status: `MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md` section 0 and `testing/HANDOFF.md`. `NEG_CATS_PURSE_MODES` is on.
This list holds **only** open items. Everything fixed and confirmed is gone (history: `archive/STOBE_bug_history_old_numbers.md`, run logs `archive/test-run-*.md`).

**Numbering restarted on 2026-10-02:** items are numbered 1, 2, 3… here. "was N" is the old bug number (still used in commit messages and code comments). The next new item is **135**.

**How to report:** tell me roughly when (your clock) and which NPC, e.g. "Malzin around 11:02, she didn't take the vest off". Send it **before relaunching Kenshi** (logs reset on launch).

## D. Bugs fixed or open, not yet confirmed in game

Fixed and confirmed items are deleted (run log line). Full history of each row below: `git log -p STOBE_full_test_plan.md`. Where each is confirmed: `MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md` section 3.

| # | Bug | Fix / state |
|---|---|---|
| 70, 108 | template-name relationship keys (Dust Bandit Bowman, Berserker) came back via the save-follow restore / new fights | fixed live (197d921, 945dfe1: map reads/writes drop template keys, `data/npc_generic_templates.json`) |
| 86 | game re-reported `Initiated attack` during a truce, so a paid surrender turned BREACHED_PLAYER | fixed live (f98b88e, e9f8598: a breach needs real evidence within 8 s; older-save load cancels later deals) |
| 87 | Dust King: no initiative check (his attack was stood down by another personal-fight guard) | test procedure fixed; covered by 88 + 61 PASS m18 |
| 94 | `stobe-reset-npc --restore` wrote "shay" instead of "Shay" | fixed (tool) |
| 99 | WAITING_APPROVAL never offered for a trader-only ingredient | fixed (goal code, in Stobe.dll since m49: carried goods + nearest stocking trader) |
| 101 | `[]` extended_data broke relationship writes | fixed live (3e50770), rows repaired |
| 105 | KenshiFP log spam (30k `WORK_GOAL input ratio` lines) | fixed (KenshiFP 5719BEA5+) |

## E. Design questions and features

- **B 55 fight rules: built (StobeServer 1392155) and confirmed in game (m22, all blocks PASS).** The full spec (Shay,
  2026-10-03) is in git (`git show 6391c32 -- STOBE_full_test_plan.md`). Summary of the rules in force: severity by the
  victim's state when the fight ends/she wakes (not hurt -10..-15, wounded -23..-30, KO moderate -40..-50, KO severe/bleeding
  -55..-65, limb -68..-78) x closeness before the fight (Friendly 1.3, Fond 2.0, Devoted 2.5, Bonded 3.0; floor -100);
  grudges up to "wounded" fade over ~14 game days, KO or worse never fades by itself; kept deal wins back 0..1/3; consensual
  sparring free; no chat gains for 1 game day; only fights with the squad or a conscious named NPC count; the first fight
  leaves a permanent memory fact, gains at half rate while a grudge is open; broken deal/truce -20..-40, accident 0.25x,
  self-defence 0; treating her wounds afterwards takes off 15-30 % (never positive).
