# KenshiFP — First-Person Mode for Kenshi

Play Kenshi in true first person: the camera is welded to your character's
head, and the RTS click-to-move scheme is replaced with WASD + mouse-look.
Built as a native code plugin — no game files are modified.

**Current release: v0.6.1** — jumping, airborne mesh collision, full-body
first-person locomotion (8-way movement, turn-in-place, foot IK), and an
install with nothing to keep together (animation pack and UI images are
embedded in the DLL).

**Two editions cover every Kenshi build:**

- **Standalone** — for standard Steam. Ships address tables for both **1.0.68
  and 1.0.65** and auto-detects the build at load; on an unrecognized build it
  disables itself cleanly (logged). Windows or Linux/Proton.
- **RE_Kenshi Edition** — runs as an
  [RE_Kenshi](https://www.nexusmods.com/kenshi/mods/2063) plugin and resolves
  its hooks by runtime signature scan, so it works on **every build RE_Kenshi
  supports — GOG and old versions included**. Feature-identical to the
  standalone.

## Features

- **In-game settings panel** — press **F10** for a live settings window:
  sliders for FOV, sensitivity, and camera feel, plus checkboxes for every
  feature toggle, all applied instantly. A "Reset to Defaults" button, close
  via the X / Escape / F10. No more editing files by hand (the `.ini` still
  works and stays in sync).
- **True first-person camera** — attached to the head bone; tracks
  animations and ragdolls, roll-free, with FOV and near-clip tuned for FP.
  The camera **leads your movement** and scales with game speed, so it keeps
  up at 2x/5x.
- **Engine-native WASD movement** — drives the game's own direction-based
  locomotion: reliable **inside buildings**, on ramps and platforms, real
  walk/jog/run gaits. WASD **overrides move orders**, works **with UI panels
  open** (inventory/squad/jobs), and **gets you up** from playing dead, beds,
  or sitting.
- **Works in combat** — WASD wins the fight's locomotion race, so retreat,
  strafe, and kite work even while locked onto a target.
- **Character switching** — first person follows your *selected* squad
  member; camera-lock another character and FP swaps to them.
- **Aim-lean** — with a weapon drawn, your character physically bends
  through the spine as you look up/down (procedural spine IK).
- **Ranged free-aim in combat** — the aim pose tracks your crosshair,
  bolts fly where you aim (vanilla accuracy spread kept), and lock-on no
  longer overrides your look.
- **Ragdoll camera** — knocked out, the camera tumbles with your head
  (roll/pitch/yaw) and recovers on get-up.
- **Mouse-look via DirectInput** — raw-quality hardware deltas that coexist
  with the game's own input (no stolen registrations, no cursor-warp lag).
- **Scroll wheel speed control** — from a slow walk to a full run.
- **Turn in place** — your character's body follows the camera while idle.
- **Colored crosshair** — replaces the arrow cursor; turns **red over
  hostiles** and **yellow over allies**; the game's tool cursors (talk,
  doors, loot) still appear when relevant.
- **Smart cursor release** — the mouse frees automatically for dialogue,
  inventory, trade/looting, stats, map/factions, options, save/load,
  message boxes, and the right-click context menu; recaptures on close.
- **Building interiors preload** as you approach from outside — no more
  empty doorways.
- **Foliage fix** — grass no longer vanishes underfoot in first person.
- **Unconsciousness blackout** — knocked out, the screen fades to black
  through a closing tunnel; on coming to, vision returns with a gradual
  wake-up fade while the camera untumbles.
- **Live-tunable settings** — via the F10 panel (above) or by editing
  `KenshiFP.ini`, which is **hot-reloaded in-game** (edit and save, changes
  apply within a second). Toggles (aim-lean, ranged free-aim, wheel speed,
  KO blackout), camera/feel tuning (`fov`, `near_clip`, `sensitivity`,
  `eye_forward`, `move_forward`, `move_speed_ref`, `aim_lean_amount`), key
  rebinds (FP toggle, WASD, settings key), and an FPS cap (`fps_cap=N` —
  precise frame limiting without vsync).
- **Framerate-independent mouse** — look input captured at ~1kHz on a
  dedicated thread; identical feel at any fps.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **Right Alt** | Toggle first-person on/off for the selected character |
| **Mouse** | Look |
| **W A S D** | Move (camera-relative) |
| **Scroll wheel** | Movement speed (walk ↔ run) |
| **F10** | Open/close the settings panel |
| Everything else | Vanilla Kenshi bindings |

All keys are rebindable in `KenshiFP.ini`.

## Installation

**Standalone edition** (standard Steam):

1. Download the standalone release zip.
2. Copy `KenshiFP_x64.dll` and the `kenshifp/` folder into your Kenshi
   install directory (next to `kenshi_x64.exe`).
3. Open `Plugins_x64.cfg` in the same directory and add this line at the
   end of the plugin list:
   ```
   Plugin=KenshiFP_x64
   ```
4. Launch the game, select a character, press **Right Alt**.

**RE_Kenshi edition** (GOG / old builds / anyone using RE_Kenshi):

1. Download the RE_Kenshi edition zip.
2. Copy the `KenshiFP` folder into your Kenshi `mods/` folder.
3. Enable **KenshiFP** in the in-game mod list. (Requires
   [RE_Kenshi](https://www.nexusmods.com/kenshi/mods/2063).) Do **not** also
   add the `Plugin=` line — that's the standalone only.

To uninstall the standalone, remove that line (and optionally the files); for
the RE_Kenshi edition, disable it in the mod list.

A log (`KenshiFP.log`) is written next to the game exe — include it in any
bug report.

## Compatibility

- **RE_Kenshi:** the standalone edition runs with or without it (RE_Kenshi
  downgrades installs to 1.0.65; KenshiFP auto-detects and adapts). On **GOG
  or any other build**, use the **RE_Kenshi edition**, which resolves its
  hooks by runtime signature scan and works on every build RE_Kenshi supports.
- Coexists fine with other mods that don't replace the game executable.

## Known limitations

- The settings panel opens **in-game**, not on the main menu.
- Backpedaling (S) turns the character around rather than walking backward
  facing the camera (the engine's physics drives orientation during
  movement; a facing-locked backpedal is future work).
- Grass billboards shimmer when rotating the view — an engine impostor
  artifact that eye-level viewing makes more visible.

## Building from source

Cross-compiles from Linux (or MSYS2) with mingw-w64 — no Windows SDK
needed. Both editions build from the same `client/kenshifp_client.c`:

```sh
cd client && ./build.sh          # standalone -> KenshiFP_x64.dll
cd re_plugin && ./build.sh       # RE_Kenshi edition -> KenshiFP.dll
```

The RE_Kenshi edition is the same client compiled with `-DKFP_RE_PLUGIN`, so
it resolves game addresses by runtime signature scan instead of the hard-coded
per-version tables. Requires `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` with
`libdinput8`/`libdxguid` (mingw-w64 ships both).
[MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) (BSD-2-Clause) is vendored
under `third_party/minhook/`.

## How it works

The DLL loads through Ogre's plugin path and detours the game's per-frame
update plus the camera update with MinHook. All game structures and
functions were located by reverse engineering the 1.0.68 binary with
headless Ghidra — the offset map and methodology live in `re/NOTES.md` and
`DESIGN.md`. Risky calls into game code run inside a vectored-exception
guard, so a bad pointer degrades a feature (with a log line) instead of
crashing the game.

Field-layout documentation from the
[KenshiLib](https://github.com/KenshiReclaimer/KenshiLib) headers was used
as a reference map during reverse engineering (function addresses there are
stale for 1.0.68; every address this mod calls was re-derived and verified
against the live binary).
