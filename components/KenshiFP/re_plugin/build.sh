# Build KenshiFP.dll -- the RE_Kenshi plugin (Path B): the FULL standalone
# client compiled with -DKFP_RE_PLUGIN, so g_rva is resolved by runtime
# signature scan (version-independent) and the entry point is startPlugin()
# (exported as ?startPlugin@@YAXXZ via plugin.def).
#
# NO MinHook: the RE edition installs its hooks through KenshiLib::AddHook
# (RE_Kenshi's own hooking service), so this DLL contains NO inline-hook /
# trampoline / executable-alloc machinery. That keeps its static profile clean
# for antivirus (the "BehavesLike.Injector" / Wacatac ML heuristics score on
# exactly that machinery) -- the actual code patching happens inside
# KenshiLib.dll, which RE_Kenshi ships and manages.
